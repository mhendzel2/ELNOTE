# PITR Drill Artifacts

Timestamped restore-drill evidence files are written here by `scripts/run_pitr_drill.sh`.

Each run creates `pitr-drill-<UTC timestamp>.json` with:

- start/end timestamps
- target recovery timestamp
- restore verification results
- audit-chain verification status
- gaps/action items
